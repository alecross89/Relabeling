# Relabeling

### Setup
It is probably best to create a venv with `python3` (I used `python 3.6`).  If you're using `conda` then create a venv:
``` 
$ conda create -n my_venv_name python=3.6
```
Then clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/alecross89/Relabeling.git
```
Switch into the `Relabeling` folder
```
$ cd Relabeling
```

Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
Then load the images you would like to label in this directory.  The file structure should be like this:
```
    ├── Relabeling                    
    │   ├── relabel.py       
    │   ├── requirements.txt      
    │   └── image_folder_name
            ├── image id folder (ex. d2c7e807-0d75-48ce-980e-36666939f131)         
            │   ├── rgb.png        
            ├── ...
```

### Running

**Mac/Linux:**
To run the program, you must include the path to the image folder w.r.t `relabel.py`, for example: 
```
$ python relabel.py './image_folder_name/'
```
You can test the program by running the following command and classifying 6 images:
```
$ python relabel.py './test_folder/'
```
**Windows:**
Its the same thing except leave out the quotes when putting in the path, for ex.:
```
$ python relabel.py ./image_folder_name/
```
Once you start classifying images, the image IDs will be placed in seperate text files depending on if they were labeled empty or not-empty.  

To mark image as **Empty** - **Left Arrow**

To mark image as **Not Empty** - **Right Arrow**
